## Introduction

This app provides you the data on social indicators of all countries. You can customize the data as per your requirements just by a click.



--- .class #id 

## WHO data

The dataset consists of 177 observations with 9 parameters such as Country, Region, Fertility Rate, Population, etc.

The following are the variables of the dataset:
```{r, message=F, warning=F, echo=FALSE}
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
dat_main <- read.csv("D:/MBA/Data Analytics/R/Developing Data Products/WHO.csv")
summary(dat_main)
```

--- .class #id 

## The core idea

- Categorical variables are listed in the GUI as checkboxes
- Numerical variables are listed as slider input
- You can vary the slider or use the checkboxes to customize the data according to your needs immediately
